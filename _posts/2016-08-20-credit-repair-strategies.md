title: Credit Repair Strategies - 6 Key Strategies
---

If you are searching for the best way to repair credit ratings, then you have probably gotten yourself into trouble with too much debt. There are critical steps you need to take to get a handle on your debt and clean up your credit score in the fastest way possible. Beware of the credit repair agencies and counselors. They work on a retainer basis. They actually want the clean up of your credit to take as long as possible, because they keep charging each month for their services.

The absolutely best way to repair credit requires the following fundamental critical steps be taken to quickly start raising your credit rating:

- Get a copy of your credit report. Quickly identify any mistakes. Write to the agencies with all supporting information substantiating your claim that it is a mistake.

- Resolve and close any collection accounts. Do not agree to pay them off until you get in writing that they will remove it from all credit score reports that it shows up on.

- Apply for a secured credit card. If you are unable to obtain a credit card, you can get a card with a small secured balance through a credit union or local bank. You basically put your cash in a savings account that is held as collateral for your credit line. Use the card sparingly and pay off monthly. This is the best way to repair credit if creditors won't extend credit anymore.

- Pay down your credit balances to 30% of your credit line. 30% is the magic number that the agencies require to boost your credit quickly. Start with your credit card that is closest to 30% and pay it down. When you get to 30%, move to the next closest one and do the same, until you have them all down to 30% or below.

- Have balanced credit types. If you have all credit cards, the agencies will knock your score down. Take out a small installment type loan from your bank or credit union.

- Don't get rid of older credit cards. Older credit lines add more value to your credit rating score than newer lines. If you must get rid of a card or two, make sure it is one of your newest ones.

- Using the outright best way to repair credit issues is pretty straight forward and simple. While there are a lot of strategies for cleaning up bad scores fast, using the above critical steps will help you get on track as fast as possible.
