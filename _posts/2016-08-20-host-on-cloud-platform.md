We identify the best template for your business abd build a customized site that take advantage of underlying HTML 5 capabilities.

Hosting on Cloud Platform means all the websites are scalable, globally-available 24/7. You focus on your marketing efforts and we take care of the infrastructure for you. Some of the world’s most popular websites are built on Cloud Platform. All your websites, can use a bandwidth of billions of requests per day and automatically scale down when traffic subsides. We have also setup load balancers  which can balance your traffic across our global regions.

Data on the primary instance is backed up periodically, to ensure you can always restore it when needed. This 3rd Copy of data is put in a different Datacenter that the Primary and High Available (HA) instance. A synchronously replicated instance in the same Datacenter where primary instance resides, to ensure High Availability of your application/workload. 

All your data is safe with us. We sync all the data and is put in a different seismic zone which is at least 500KM away from the primary datacenter. This ensures you can always recover the systems in the event of any disaster/outages in the Primary DC, thus giving you a complete business continuity without any services distribution
