title: Tips For Repairing Credit on Your Own
---

Consumers would benefit from a higher credit score, especially in times like today. Though an easy way to repair credit would be through a company specializing in such, some prefer to take matters into their own hands. The following tips are avenues which they should take to do so.

Determine Your FICO Score. In the financial realm we are graded according to how well we have performed in that area of education. These grades are manifest through our FICO scores, ranging approximately from 350 to 850. Knowing your grade, or FICO score, in relation to others tells you how much need for improvement you actually have.

Request Your Credit Report. Once a year the three credit-reporting bureaus offer a complimentary credit report. Aside from giving your credit score, this report will give the exact information reported for your name and whether the information is negative or positive. Review each line, searching for any inaccuracies.

Correct Any Errors You Find. After looking through your credit report, determine whether there have been any mistakes entered. Errors may have occurred through outdated information, or incomplete or inaccurate account history. If so, fill out the dispute form included in your credit report and return it and any supporting paperwork to the credit-reporting agencies.

Call Your Creditors. A simple way to correct mistakes may be through contacting your creditors yourself. If you have a past-due account, many collectors are eager to receive payment of any kind and are open to bargaining. After taking the necessary action, ask them to remove your name from their list for Collections.

Be Punctual in Your Payments. Consistent and timely payment will increase your FICO score more than you realize. Such action illustrates your reliability and responsibility with money management. If this is an area of difficulty, consider paying your bills automatically.

Avoid Unnecessary Debt. While good advice anytime, this tip is especially important during reparation of credit. Distinguish between your needs and your wants. Establish those distinctions with other members of the household you provide for.

Request a credit report and take a look at your credit score. Abstain from any actions which have lowered your FICO credit score in the past, and continue building on what will strengthen it in the future. Though the road may be difficult, the destination will bring immense satisfaction.
