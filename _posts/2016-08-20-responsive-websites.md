All our websites are completely responsive and we continue to add more new templates which expand to fill the entire width of the screen. A website with responsive web design is a site that is able to adapt to the screen it is being used on, regardless of what device it is. The website automatically reformats to give the user a better experience that it well suited to their device, and can give your site a number of benefits as well as being in line with Google recommendations.

Ofcom reported that two thirds of people in the UK now own a smartphone, using it for at least two hours every day to browse the internet, scroll through social media, carry out online banking and even online shop. 33% of internet users see their smartphone as the most important device for going online, and we spend twice as long online with our smartphones than laptops or personal computers. This could have a direct impact on the way we view websites.

Ofcom’s report revealed that in 2014 only 22% turned to their phone first for browsing the internet; proving a real surge in mobile use. The availability of 4G has also impacted how people use their mobile devices. Over the course of 2014, 4G subscriptions skyrocketed from 2.7 million to 23.6 million.

For these reasons alone, it is important that you have a website that works well on a smartphone or other mobile device’s screen, due to the sheer amount of people who could be using your website through a smartphone or tablet.

### Benefits Of Responsive Web Design

With a responsive website, the content and pages are automatically flexible, fluid across all screen resolutions and various devices. In other words, no matter what device you are viewing a website on, the user will have optimal viewing experience including ease of navigation with a minimum amount of resizing and scrolling.

A responsive design can improve user experience and accommodate everyone, whether they are on a desktop or a smartphone or tablet. In providing the best possible experience, people will have a positive opinion of your website, meaning they will most probably return.

Through ensuring that your website is responsive, you essentially only have one website instead of two. This is much more cost effective; as opposed to having a separate mobile site to maintain, you only have your main site to look after. Likewise, SEO campaigns are much easier to maintain with only one site; if you were to have a separate mobile site, you then have two SEO campaigns. A responsive website is all round much easier to manage.

With the importance of mobile-friendly websites only increasing, take a minute to ensure your web design is the best it can be!
